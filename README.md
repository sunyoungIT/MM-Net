We used the clinical dataset of the 2016 NIH-AAPM-Mayo Clinic Low-Dose CT Grand Challenge

I have created a GitHub repository to share the code for the paper 'MM-Net: Multiframe and Multimask-Based Unsupervised Deep Denoising for Low-Dose Computed Tomography.' I am currently working on it. 
If you are interested in sharing the code, please feel free to contact me at sunyounge_@ewhain.net. I will update it soon.
## Overall architecture
### Two-step training network

## First Training Step :
### Multiscale Attention U-Net 
The code for attention U-Net can be found at https://github.com/LeeJunHyun/Image_Segmentation. You can find more detailed networks available there.
