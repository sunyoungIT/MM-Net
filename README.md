I have created a GitHub repository to share the code for the paper 'MM-Net: Multiframe and Multimask-Based Unsupervised Deep Denoising for Low-Dose Computed Tomography.' I am currently working on it. 
If you are interested in sharing the code, please feel free to contact me at sunyounge_@ewhain.net. I will update it soon.
